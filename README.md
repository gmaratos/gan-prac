# MNIST Gan
Yet another introduction to Generative Adversarial Networks with MNIST.
GAN's are a special type of network that is able to learn to model a
distribution, which can be simple things like a normal or complicated
like handwritten digits. In this repository I try to simplify, as
much as I can, the procedures for defining and training such networks
in Pytorch.
